When the clipboard changes, it sends a package with type kdeconnect.clipboard
and the field "content" (string) containing the new clipboard content.

When it receivest a package of the same kind, it should update the system
clipboard with the received content, so the clipboard in both devices always
have the same content.

This plugin is symmetric to its counterpart in the other device: both have the
same behaviour.
