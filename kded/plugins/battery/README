This plugins receives packages with type "kdeconnect.battery" and reads the
following fields:

isCharging (boolean): If the battery of the peer device is charging
currentCharge (int): The charge % of the peer device
thresholdEvent (int) [optional when = 0, see below]:
    means that a battery threshold event were fired on the remote device:
        0 := no event. generally not transmitted.
        1 := battery entered in low state
    This is an int so in the future we'll be able to subscribe to more events.
    (see BatteryPlugin.ThresholdBatteryEvent)

<TODO>
Symmetrically, it sends its own battery information in packages with the same
format.
</TODO>

It also sends packages with type kdeconnect.battery and a field "request": true,
to ask the peer device to send a package like the mentioned above, and should
also answer this same kind of packages with its own information.

If the battery is low and discharging, it will notify the user.
