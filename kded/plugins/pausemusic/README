This simple plugin will just listen to "kdeconnect.telephony" like the telephony
plugin does. It reads the field "event", to see if it is "ringing" or "talking"
and then pauses all the music/video players reachable through MPRIS. When the
same kind of package is received but the boolean "isCancel" is set to true, it
will resume the playback of all the paused sources.
